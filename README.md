# Life-Detox-Discord-Bot
This is the code for a Moderation Bot I made for Discord

Commands:

$response on
Activates the bot, the bot will come into the server automatically activated

$response off
Deactivates the bot. 

Open the LifeDetox.py file to get the code for the bot. 
Warning! Many of the examples that I had to feed the Cohere machine learning algorithm are 
extremely inappropriate, as this bot is intended to moderate Discord chats. 
Proceed with caution. You have been warned.
